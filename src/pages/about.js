        <p>I am an illustrator and I'm here to purge my visual creation onto anyone who doesn't mind the mess :) I am currently residing in a city just outside of Toronto with two cats I'm trying to convince to love me more. I also enjoy gardening, the colour hot pink, horror manga, pop music and listening to interviews with rappers.</p>

        <p>My illustrations for Reveal News' Instagram post for an investigative article about exploiting human labour were among the submitted materials to earn a spot as a Pulitzer finalist in 2017. I am also a staff illustrator for the Global Press Accuracy Network.</p>
